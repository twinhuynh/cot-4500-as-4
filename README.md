This program reads given details such as iterations, matrices, tolerance, initial iteration, etc. Then uses methods given below:


Jacobi Iterative Method

Gauss-Seidel Iterative Method

SOR Method

Iterative Refinement Method


to find approximate solutions as well as the number of iterations it took.


Assignment: Programming Assignment 4

Author: Tuyen Huynh

School: UCF

Language: Python

To compile:

If you are using replit to run the python file, you will need to go into config files (.replit) and the entry point to "main.py" as well as the run to ["python3", "main.py"].
Execute by clicking the "Run" button

TEST CASES:

"A" and "b" matrices can be changed to fit the desired case. 
Tolerance and max iteration can be changed to fit the disired case as well.


NOTE: This program does not need any library installation other than the basics that comes with python3, but it will be using the "Fraction" module to assist with keeping the numbers more accurate.
